            37Coins provides a set of simple and powerful REST APIs to provide support for client side hierarchical deterministic (HD) multisignature wallets.
            It alleviates the need for direct blockchain connectivity and simplify design and requirements for wallets.
            The APIs provide the means to create and query watch only wallets, create and publish transactions, receive notifications and/or storage private keys.
            <br/><br/>
            The APIs are:<br/>
            - Chains: A REST+JSON API to create and manage watch only wallets, generate new addresses, create (but not sign) and publish transactions, send notifications and query wallet balance and transaction list.<br/>
            - Oracle: A REST+JSON API to create HD keychains, store seeds and sign transactions in a HD multisignature/multi factor authentication scenario. Users receive a phone call and enter a PIN to validate their identity.<br/>
            - Socket: A websocket API that publishes "Chains" and "Oracle" notifications for client wallets that can not provide a callback URL<br/>
            <br/>
            The 3 APIs can be used together or isolated.<br/>
            A bitcoin exchange can use just "Oracle" to store a key in a 2 of 3 multisig environment. <br/>
            A web wallet can use "Chains" to manage the waller backend; use 2 of 2 multisig and store one key in the browser and another key in "Oracle"; and use "Socket" to receive notifications. <br/>
            <br/>
            There are "Chains" and "Oracle" clients written in Java.<br/>
